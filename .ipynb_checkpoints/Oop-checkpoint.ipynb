    "### Explanation of the Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram illustrates the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and the relationship between classes and objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: The central concept, represented at the top, is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes.\n",
    "- **Properties (Variables)**: These are attributes or data members (e.g., name, age, gender) that define the characteristics of an object.\n",
    "- **Methods (Functions)**: These are behaviors or actions (e.g., greeting) that an object can perform.\n",
    "- **Content**: Refers to the combination of properties and methods that make up the structure of a class.\n",
    "- **Class (Machinery to produce dictionaries/objects)**: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that objects will have. The class acts as the \"machinery\" to generate objects.\n",
    "- **Type**: Indicates the category or kind of class, which can be:\n",
    "  - **Static Class (Homogeneous/similar)**: A class where all instances share the same structure and behavior.\n",
    "  - **Dynamic Class (Unique product)**: A class where instances can have unique attributes or behaviors.\n",
    "- **Object (dictionary)**: An instance of a class, represented as a dictionary (key-value pairs) containing the properties and methods. It is the output or result of instantiating a class.\n",
    "- **Object (dictionary) Output of a class [instance of a class]**: Shows a specific example of an object with attributes like `name: \"Akash\"`, `age: 23`, and `gender: \"Male\"`, created from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Class Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** in OOP is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data (properties) and functions (methods) that operate on the data. An **object** is an instance of a class, created using the class blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**: Think of it as a mold or recipe. For example, a `Person` class might define that every person has a `name`, `age`, and a `greeting` method. The class itself doesn’t hold specific data until an object is created.\n",
    "- **Object**: When you create an object (e.g., `user1 = Person()`), it becomes a concrete entity based on the class. Each object can have its own unique data (e.g., `user1.name = \"Chota mama\"` or `user2.name = \"Akash\"`), but it inherits the structure and methods defined in the class.\n",
    "- **Relationship**: The class is the general template, while objects are specific instances. Multiple objects can be created from the same class, each with potentially different property values but the same methods.\n",
    "- **Dictionary Representation**: In the diagram, an object is likened to a dictionary because it stores key-value pairs (e.g., `name: \"Akash\"`, `age: 23`), which is a common way to represent object attributes in some programming contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a class defines the \"what\" (structure and behavior), and an object is the \"who\" (a specific realization of that definition). This relationship allows for code reusability and organization in OOP."
